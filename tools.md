Yes, this isn't an excellent scope however given what I use it for and my budget at the current moment it's the best I'll get for now. Some day I'll pick up a $400ish desktop unit that's better but thats for later.
#### AOYUE 469 Soldering Iron (again not good but good enough)
#### 4X HP EliteDesk G4 800 Mini, my lovely energy-efficient servers

### This list will be updated when I get new stuff and whenever I get to complete it
